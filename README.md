# Social Network API

## Karrie Garzelloni


## The Task
This project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js] and [Mongoose] packages. 

No seed data is provided, so data is created using Insomnia to test the API routes.

Because this application isn't deployed, you'll find a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality, linked below.
